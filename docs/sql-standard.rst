SQL Standard
============

`ISO/IEC 9075 <https://www.iso.org/standard/76583.html>`_ is the formal name for
what is more colloquially known as the *SQL standard*. Every few years a new
`version is published <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#Standardization_history>`_.

Each version is split into multiple parts.
`Part 2: Foundation (SQL/Foundation) <https://www.iso.org/standard/76584.html>`_
is the largest part (in terms of pages) and covers the syntax and behavior for
the core SQL language. It's also the most relevant part for this project.

Each version brings new features, but most of the general features commonly used
have been published by 2003 **and that will be the ideal standard for us to work
against.** Older versions (such as 1999) are still relevant and helpful because
they still contain most of the core features.

**Unfortunately, the SQL Standard is not free (and is very expensive).** This
includes all previous versions. This is obviously a challenge for an open-source
project. While we cannot include a copy of the standard, the next best option is
to provide a list of locations where it exists:

* `SQL:2003 (working draft) <https://synthesis.frccsc.ru/synthesis/student/oodb/essayRef/sqlFoundation.pdf>`_
* `SQL:1999 (final draft) (1) <https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~len/sql1999.pdf>`_
* `SQL:1999 (final draft) (2) <http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs123/sql99std/ansi-iso-9075-2-1999.pdf>`_
* `SQL-99 Complete, Really <https://sql-99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is the digitized version of `the book with the same name <https://www.amazon.com/SQL-99-Complete-Really-Peter-Gulutzan/dp/0879305681>`_ brought to you by CrateDB.
