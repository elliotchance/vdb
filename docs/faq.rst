Why are my field/column names in upper case?
--------------------------------------------

The SQL standard defines two types of identifiers: *regular* and *delimited*. A
regular identifier is a word (such as ``foo``) whereas a delimited identifier is
surrounded by double-quotes (such as ``"foo"``).

The SQL standard states that regular identifiers are always converted to
upper-case. Apart from being styling choice, this also means that regular
identifiers are not case-sensitive so ``foo``, ``Foo`` and ``FOO`` are all valid
and all mean the same thing, but will be represented as ``FOO``.

Conversely, delimited identifiers keep their case. So ``"foo"`` and ``"Foo"``
are not the same. But it's worth noting that all identifiers still exist in the
same set, so ``"FOO"`` and ``FOO`` (or, ``foo``, ``Foo``, etc) *are* actually
the same.

These rules apply to all identifiers (table names, column names, ``AS`` names,
etc). So, using delimited identifiers also allows you to control the alias, for
example: ``SELECT 1 + 2 AS "the Total"`` will keep the column name
``the Total``.

Why is there no "LIMIT" syntax?
-------------------------------

Several open source databases provide a ``LIMIT`` style syntax. However, this is
not part of the SQL standard. The standard way to perform these are:

1. ``OFFSET 5 ROWS`` skips the first 5 rows.
2. ``FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY`` will return a maximum of 3 rows (equivilent to ``LIMIT 3``).
3. ``OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY`` will skip the first row and return a maximum of 5 rows.

Where can I find the SQL standard?
----------------------------------

The SQL standard is not free. However, you can find older versions publically
available and these will be close enough to use as a reference:

1. [SQL 2016 Foundation Grammar (BNF)](https://jakewheat.github.io/sql-overview/sql-2016-foundation-grammar.html)
2. [SQL 1999](https://crate.io/docs/sql-99/en/latest//)

Wait! You said this is pure V but I see a Python file?
------------------------------------------------------

The python file ``generate-grammar.py`` is used to convert the BNF grammar into
V code that makes up the parser. The result file ``grammar.v`` is committed so
there is no need to use python to compile and otherwise work on vsql unless you
need to change the grammar. However, if you would like to covert this script to
V, I'd be happy to have your help!
